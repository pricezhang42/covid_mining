Before running the Python code, install geopands with "conda install geopandas"

IMPORTANT: There is an error in the most recent version of one of the modules used by geopandas. The error can cause coordinate transformations to fail. It occurs when the .to_crs() method is called and looks like this:
pyproj.exceptions.ProjError: x, y, z, and time must be same size
